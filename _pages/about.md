I am a master student in computer science at [AmirKabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/).
My academic background is data mining and I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence projects and big data.

I started programming professionally sicnce 2016 till now and am currently working at a company in [Pardis Technology Park](https://en.techpark.ir/).

I'm very interested in data science and its use in banking and finance. My academic thesis is also in this field.
I have experience working in large companies such as [Sadad Informatic Corporation](https://sadad.co.ir/en/). We were working on the bale messenger project.

I've been reading about blockchain for a while now and I've just done a project with [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric).
